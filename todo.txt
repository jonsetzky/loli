riot client has started and still spamming "not alive\nstarting lol client"
	stops when leagueoflegends text pops on screen

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\lockfile'

starting takes forever, first white blank screen
	and after 30 seconds a loading screen

make champ select timer take into account possible latency to server and the time it's allowed to go over the timer
	also make a tooltip where this is explained
	- champ select is allowed to go to a timer of -3 (in practice tool) (sample size of 2)

todo add other languages besides english to dragontail
	also make the assets to be added programmatically so build doesn't depend on the build environment!!!!!!!

starting sometimes doesn't load players icon in the navbar



match found screen is cursed

lockfile info is scuffed

electron.exe stays in the task manager and hogs about 10% of cpu. this is problematic since i had 3 of them after a dev session. not acceptable!!!!!!!!!

filter out disabled queues (have an option in settings to toggle this behaviour)
    enabledqueueids
        /lol-platform-config/v1/namespaces/ClientSystemStates

/lol-game-queues/v1/queues
    use this instead of the piss useless hook that i created that fetches queues.json from static rito server.

/sanitizer/v1/status
    this can be used to estimate how toxic the user is

add a notification to the end user when loli client is running using dialogs (example in the playground)
    lcu.simple_dialog_messages.postMessages

support for brawl champ & rune selection
    endpoint for setting champ & rune /lol-lobby/v1/lobby/members/localMember/player-slots
    ? endpoint for seeing whether gamemode has champ select or not?
        "showPositionSelector": false,
        "showQuickPlaySlotSelection": true
        @ /lol-lobby/v2/lobby

ranked lobby results in a gigantic rank (because lobby is at max 2 players)

DONE
build randomly fails probs because of dragontail part in the build command (in npm install)
